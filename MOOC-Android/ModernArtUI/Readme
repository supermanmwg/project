1 SeekBar is finished.
  When the user drags the SeekBar,all non-whilte/nong grey rectangles gradually change their color.
2 Problem:
	setBackgroundColor(int color);
  the color should be 32bit ,8 bytes. like 0xFFFFFFFF is white.
  If you pass 0xFFFFFF ,the color is disappeared and become transparent.
  But the color also can be Color.parseColor("#fffff").it is right to describe 
  color using string "#XXXXXX".the string is 6 Bytes.
