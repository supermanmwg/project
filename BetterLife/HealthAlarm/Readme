 objective :  To help  elder people to control themselves in playing games.
 				when I start the app ,an 20 minutes alarm is created. when the alarm is active.
 				a music will plays until the elder people shake the phone off.
 				It will alarm elder people to have a rest when they play game 20 minutes long.
 Process: (1) First we create MainActivity , and create an alarm in it. when the alarm is active ,it will active SecondActivity.
 		  (2) Second we create SecondActivity, it will play an music until elder people shake it off.
 		      when the elder people shake the phone off,it will turn to MainActivity.
 
Current condition: this app doesn't add music.  This is a basic version. There are more function to be added in the future.
